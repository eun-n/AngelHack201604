# AngelHack201604
-
-This is our tentative github page for our AngelHack 2016 idea. 
-
-An app for peer to peer help on demand. 
-A user would post a picture/video of a problem and tag it with a category.
-Other users would be able to monitor certain tags that they are experts in. 
-They can accept requests posted in the tag and then connect directly to the poster via live video to assist.
-
-Eventually posters can offer a bounty/reward to whoever is able to help them with their requests.
