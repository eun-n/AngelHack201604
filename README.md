# AngelHack201604
-
-This is our tentative github page for our AngelHack 2016 idea. 
-
-An app for peer to peer help on demand. 
-A user would post a picture of a problem and tag it with a category.
-Our app would first look through the wikiHow API for articles that might be able to help the user.
-If the user is unable to solve their issue, they could request to connect to a "professional".
-Professionals would be able to monitor certain tags that they are proficient in. 
-They can accept requests posted in the tag and then connect directly to the poster via live video to assist.
-
-Eventually posters can offer a bounty/reward to their requests to pay to the professional that helps them.
